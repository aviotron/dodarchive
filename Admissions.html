  </p>
  <p><strong>Eligibility criteria for BDes at IIT Guwahati</strong><br />
    Candidates applying for the undergraduate (B.Des) course in Design should 
    fulfill following criteria:<br />
    <br />
    1. Candidate should have a valid score for the Undergraduate Common
    Entrance Examination for Design (UCEED) conducted by IITs. You may find<br />
    more information about UCEED <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/uceed/2017/" class="voilet_text">here</a>. <br />
    <br />
    2.  Candidate have passed the qualifying examination (Class XII or  equivalent) with physics, chemistry and mathematics as subjects.</p>
  <strong>Seat Allotment algorithm &amp; Admission Process.</strong><br/>
  Since there is a single merit list the seat allotment  algorithm is simple. In round 1, the seats are provisionally allotted to the  candidates based on their choices, the seat available as per the seat matrix  and their UCEED ranks.
  Digital copies of Certificates are verified and if found in  order, a candidate gets the seat allotment letter, with a provision to either  freeze or float. The candidates accept the seats provisionally allotted by  paying 60000 through common online payment portal.<br />
    <br />
    A candidate getting his first choice has it frozen - there  is no further possibility of upgradation. Candidates not getting their first  choice can exercise either of the two. They pay Rs. 60000 (a part of their semester fees) through  common online payment portal.  A  candidate can withdraw from the process prior to the third round (i.e., latest  after the completion of the second round) and the tuition fees will be refunded  in part (50% refund of the part of the semester fees paid, i.e., Rs. 30000 will  be refunded). Withdrawal any later than that will mean NO refund of the part of  the fees paid. Withdrawal after the first round may lead to FULL refund of the  part of the semester fees paid, depending on the decision of the UCEED  committee.</p>
    <p>If there are no vacancies at the end of the first round  there will be NO second round. However, if a vacancy is created due to a  candidate vacating a seat (due to say, getting admission to IITs or CFTIs which  they might prefer), extra rounds of seat allotment will be conducted. Those  opting for the float option will automatically be upgraded to a higher choice  as per the list of choices. </p>
    <p>Once the candidate has got the best possible  choice at the end of the admission process (as per third admission list on July  11), he will have to report to the Institute allotted, for admission processes  as per the rules of that institute. A list of candidates admitted to each  institute will be prepared and sent. The amount of Rs. 60000 will be  transferred to that Institute where the candidate has joined. The candidate has  therefore to pay the remaining part of the fees to the Institute upon joining. Students admitted to the B.Des programme will not be eligible for branch  change to any other
      undergraduate programmes offered <br />
      by IIT Guwahati at any  time during the entire duration of the programme.      </p>
    <p><strong>Document verification &amp; Registration<br />
    </strong>Students accepted the admission to IITG after payment of Rs.  60,000/- will report at IIT Guwahati. Candidates will be informed in the admission  letter about the details of schedule and list of documents to produce for  verification.

  <p>
    <strong style="color:#991A97">Masters in Design (M.Des) procedure</strong><br/>
Masters in Design (M.Des) is one of the unique program offered by Department of Design (DoD), IIT Guwahati. 

 Student applying for post graduate (M.Des) program should qualify the <a href="http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/admissions/ceed.html" class="voilet_text">Common Entrance Examination for Design (CEED)</a> conducted by IITs as a part of their central admission procedure. They are further shortlisted through apptitude test and further on through a personal interview session. You can view the course structure for M.Des</p>
 <p>You may find the course structure for MDes .http://www.iitg.ac.in/design/Courses.html</p>
 <p>Please visit this <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/acad/AdvtNotificationJuly2018/AdvtNotificationJuly2018.htm">http://www.iitg.ac.in/acad/AdvtNotificationJuly2018/AdvtNotificationJuly2018.htm</a><a href="http://www.iitg.ernet.in/acad/AdvtNotificationJuly2017/admissions/interviews.html"> </a>for more details on M.Des admissions for 2017. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#000000">Information regarding the Common Aptitude Test</strong><br/>
Design discipline takes students with a keen eye over colour sensitiveness, structures, perception, aesthetics, innovation and an aptitude towards the discipline. This test is conducted on the last day of the counseling sessions at all the centres. </p>
 
 <p>
 <strong style="color:#991A97">PhD program details</strong><br/>
In its quest for syncretism, the Ph.D program will emphasize investigative work in fundamental Design which is not only interdisciplinary but also intradisciplinary.

The range of disciplines of integrative interest include, but are not necessarily limited to, Usability Engineering, Interaction Design, Design Semantics, Experiential Design, Environment Design, Human –Computer Interaction Design, Ergonomics, Design Management and Product Design Engineering.

Since the program is rooted in User Centered Design, specific areas in pure engineering design such as Machine Design, Software Design, VLSI design, etc are not the focus of research. However all 'Use' and User connected design issues in pure engineering areas, regardless of the branch, fall within the ambit of the research program. 

 </p>

<p> The admission processes will consists of a seminar /presentation of a topic of the candidate's choice but related to Design. The seminar could also be in the form of a proposal for intended research consisting of problem statement, hypothesis, possible methodology and bibliography. Candidates are also encouraged to present portfolios/projects/work experience that may have a bearing on their research interest. This presentation will be followed by a formal interview/test covering fundamental and advanced topics in Design related issues.</p>

<p>
Admitted scholars have to complete a prescribed course of study (4 to 6 Courses) in the first year followed by a comprehensive examination for registration. Candidates will have to submit a thesis that not only demonstrates designing ability but also should clearly break new grounds in the disciplinary knowledge base of Design, based on investigative and experimental work.
