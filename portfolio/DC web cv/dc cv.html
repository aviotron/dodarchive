It has two parts. Part I presents an overview of anthropometry,  and methodology. Part II deals with the Indian anthropometric data pac, which contain  290 body dimensional data for males, females and male-female combined, and its relevant  applications in the field of design. This book serves as a data source on  Indian anthropometrics  and gives guidelines for general use of the same in the field of design. It is learnt  that, as a reference book it is widely used by furniture and interior design  manufacturers in  India.<br />

      I have started my active research  carrier in Department of Physiology, Calcutta University, as a postgraduate  student member of a Calcutta University research team since 1979, which was  followed by my Ph.D. thesis work. In Calcutta University, I was involved both  in the laboratory work as well as field studies. It includes setting up of  varied levels of experiments for my own Ph.D. work, other laboratory research  works and relevant to design projects, demonstration to departmental students  etc., as mentioned above in item No. 13 under various sub heads.</p>

                <p>To mention specifically, NID’s  Ergonomics laboratory was set up to cater relevant practical input to the  students and for conducting design research and evaluation of varied nature.  The Laboratory comprised of both the traditional and modern equipment and  facilities to conduct relevant studies on:<br />
